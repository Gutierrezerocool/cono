# Responsly.js

## WHAT
Dead simple responsive widgets, written using CSS3 transformations and available as a jQuery Plugin.
Currently a sideshow and accordion are available, more to come!


## WHY
Responsive designs are cool! Not only do they allow you to reach mobile and tablet users with minimal effort, they also make your context scale up for desktop users with larger screens.

Unfortunately it means in general you can't use fixed sizes throughout your CSS. While this may not be a problem for new sites, a lot of existing widgets are hard-coded to various sizes.

I had this problem when building my [blog](http://dharmeshmalam.com), and at our startup [Quillu](http://quillu.com), so I developed a slideshow and accordion using various techniques to ensure they scale with their content and well as their containing div. This comes down to ensuring that width or height are never hard coded in the CSS. Also extensive use of CSS3, particularly the transitions ensures rich UI that works great in modern browsers, with graceful degradation for IE.

We though the work could be useful for others, so it was extracted into a library for reuse.

## DEMO

Check out the [demo](http://dmmalam.github.com/Responsly.js/)


## FEATURES
* Works from large monitors to laptops, to tablets to mobiles.
* Pure CSS styling
* CSS3 based transitions (hardware accelerated where possible).
* Animations work on all modern browsers including mobile, (IE degrades gracefully by losing transitions).
* Minimal dependence on jQuery for convenience ( can substitute Zepto, or pure JavaScript).
* Simple lightweight design, adds little to your download size
* Compartmentalized, so use only what you want
* Best used with a responsive CSS framework like 1140px or 320plus
* Can be heavily customized by editing CSS

## HOW
* Download / Clone files
* Add references to CSS / JS
* Add boilerplate placeholder HTML
* Use jQuery to attach widgets.
* See demo.html for examples.

## Library
Currently there are two widgets

### Slidy
A responsive CSS based animating sideshow with many options

* Options
    * Show / hide buttons
    * Use keyboard navigation
    * Auto start slideshow, set intervals
    * Can use throttling with [jQuery throttle plugin](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/)

* Setup
    1. Add references, make sure jQuery is available

        ```html
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="slidy.css">
            <script src="slidy.js"></script>
        ```
    2. Add boilerplate HTML to wherever your want the slideshow. This is usually some responsive container

        ```html
        <div id="slidyBanner" class="slidyContainer" title="Your tooltip text">
                <div class="slidySlides">

                    <!-- Each slide is wrapped in figure section -->

                    <!-- Slide 1 -->
                    <!-- add the 'slidyCurrent' class to which slide you want as default -->
                    <figure class="slidyCurrent">
                        <!-- Your context goes here -->
                        <img  alt="Uyuni, Bolivia" src="img/banner/16 Uyuni Salt Flats - 61 - Banner.jpg">
                        <!-- Use the figcaption element to add captions -->
                        <figcaption>An Image</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <!-- Slide 2 -->
                    <figure>
                        <img  alt="Shanghai, China"  src="img/banner/2 Shanghai - 38 - Banner.jpg">
                        <figcaption>Another image</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <!-- Slide 3 -->
                    <figure>
                        <p> I am some text</p>
                        <p> Your not limited to images, you can have what ever you want </p>
                        <figcaption>Text</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <!-- Add more slides as necessary -->

                </div>
        </div>
        ```
    3. Wire up with options

        ```javascript
            <script>
            $('.slidyContainer').slidy({
                // Options go here, see slidy.js
                // These the defaults so don't only need to be specified if they are changed

                throttle: false, // Set to true, and include jQuery throttle plugin (http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/)
                throttleTime: 500, // number of ms to wait for throttling
                showArrows: true, // Show arrows for next/prev image
                movePrev: 'movePrev', // Div id to use for previous button
                moveNext: 'moveNext', // Div id to use for next button
                useKeybord: true, // use keys defined below to expand / collapse sections
                auto: false,       // Start slideshow automatically
                interval: 6000,     // Time between each slide
                initialInterval: 10000  // Initial interval when page loads

            });

        </script>
        ```

## CONTRIBUTE
We actively encourage additional widgets or improvements or features.
